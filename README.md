## About This Repository

This repository will provide my inteactive dashboard project in purpose for web application deployment. You can find python version source code and the packages requirement to deploy this as web app via hosting services. I made this repository to prove that we can develop end-to-end web app using cloud platform and no need to have powerful computer.

You can check out this repository to preview my detailed development process, that started by drafting and deployment test using google colab https://github.com/azzindani/01_Data_Analytic

I will update this repository regurally after I finished a new project.

## Interactive Dashboard vs Static Dashboard

Before we go further, I want to provide the pros and cons between interactive dashboard and static dashboard. Below are the pros and cons that can be easily you search at google or ask through AI platform:

1. Interactive dashboard
   * pros
     * Provide depth and flexibility that will lead to findings and new insights
     * Can actively engage
     * Can be used for real-time visualization, that will lead to updated information
     * Higher degree for curiosity
     * Dynamic visualization
   * cons
     * Harder to learn
     * Complexity
     * Relying on specific tool
     * Sometimes lead to performance issues and lags
3. Static dashboard
   * pros
     * Simplicity
     * Provide clear information
     * Unchanging visualization, that make it easy to interpret
     * Consistent, that make it reliable for presentation
     * Print friendly
   * cons
     * Can't be used for in-depth exploration
     * Can't be used for real-time visualization
     * Lack of interactivity that will lead to less engagement
     * Limited insights

## Why I Choose Interactive Dashboard

The reasons are:
* I need a data visualization tool that can provide the pros of interactive dashboard and simply eliminate the cons of static dashboard.
* I can tolerate the cons of interactive dashboard.
* For now, some tools can provide to save the chart images that can be used as infographic or presentation creation, which means that I still can create static dashboard using saved images of selected interactive dashboard chart and also can be printed.

## Web App Link

You can preview the dashboard via desktop or mobile phone

Disclaimer:
* This project are using the free hosting provider only, so you will find delay issue during web app preview.
* Sometime the web app loading is slow.
* This issue caused by each time the web app is being deployed, the provider will automatically delete the runtime while being idle for certain period, so you need to wait or sometime you need to re run the deployment.

You can follow the steps below to mitigate the issue:
1. Streamlit hosting
   * Click the link to open the web app
   * If no issue found the web app will be directly poped up
     <div align="center">

    </div>
    
   * If issue poped up, you can simply click "Yes, get this app back up!", and wait for 30 - 60 seconds or more until the web app finished being rendered.

## Additional Project

I created this section to present my additional project with specific purposes and use case.
1. I need to create private repository as whole project, so only some user with given access can open it.
2. This repository contain datasets, source code, configuration & credential, and packages required.
3. This project created spesificly to be used as interactive dashboard with login page that required username and password, so only registered user can access this dashboard / web application.

You can preview the dashboard through the link below (of course I already put the userneme and password to be used as credential).
